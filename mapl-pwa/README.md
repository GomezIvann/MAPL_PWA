# MaplPwa

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 10.1.0.

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Build

Run `ng build --prod` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory. The `--prod` flag is for a production build.

Then, run `http-server -p 8080 -c-1 dist/mapl-pwa` to be able to display the web app in a server, so you can download it, as a
common pwa. This just works with `http://127.0.0.1:8080` url.

If you don't have http-server, install the node package with this command: `npm install http-server -g`.
